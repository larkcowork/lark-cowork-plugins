# Campaign Plan

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../../CONNECTORS.md).

> **Lark-native execution** (depth core: [LARK-PATTERNS](../../../connectors/LARK-PATTERNS.md), [LARK-RECIPES](../../../connectors/LARK-RECIPES.md), [LARK-FUSION](../../../connectors/LARK-FUSION.md)). A campaign plan isn't a one-off message — it should land as durable, trackable Lark artifacts:
> - **The brief lands in Wiki** (P8): `lark_wiki_node_create` → fill the doc (delegate body authoring to **`lark-doc`**). This is the canonical brief the team references.
> - **The content calendar becomes a Lark Base** (P5 — system-of-record), not a static table. Don't hand-roll the schema: invoke the **`base-deploy`** skill to scaffold a "Campaign Calendar" Base (fields: Content Piece, Channel, Owner, Due, Status, Dependency). Thereafter read it with `lark_base_search` and write rows with `lark_base_record_upsert`.
> - **Each calendar row with an owner + due becomes a real task** (P2): resolve the owner via `lark_contact_search` (P1) → `lark_task_create(dry_run: true)` → confirm → commit.
> - **Stakeholder approvals are a real gate** (P7): use a Lark approval instance via the **`lark-approval`** skill / the approval recipe in LARK-RECIPES — not an ad-hoc "reply yes."
> - **Kick-off / launch milestones go on the calendar** with `lark_calendar_create`; check owner availability with `lark_calendar_freebusy`.
> - **Announce the plan as an interactive card** (P4): `lark_im_card_send` summarizing objective + KPI + next milestone, with a link to the Wiki brief and the Base.

Generate a comprehensive marketing campaign brief with objectives, audience, messaging, channel strategy, content calendar, and success metrics.

## Trigger

User runs `/campaign-plan` or asks to plan, design, or build a marketing campaign.

## Inputs

Gather the following from the user. If not provided, ask before proceeding:

1. **Campaign goal** — the primary objective (e.g., drive signups, increase awareness, launch a product, generate leads, re-engage churned users)

2. **Target audience** — who the campaign is aimed at (demographics, roles, industries, pain points, buying stage)

3. **Timeline** — campaign duration and any fixed dates (launch date, event date, seasonal deadline)

4. **Budget range** — approximate budget or budget tier (optional; if not provided, generate a channel-agnostic plan and note where budget allocation would matter)

5. **Additional context** (optional):
   - Product or service being promoted
   - Key differentiators or value propositions
   - Previous campaign performance or learnings
   - Brand guidelines or constraints
   - Geographic focus

## Campaign Brief Structure

Generate a campaign brief with the following sections:

### 1. Campaign Overview
- Campaign name suggestion
- One-sentence campaign summary
- Primary objective with a specific, measurable goal
- Secondary objectives (if applicable)

### 2. Target Audience
- Primary audience segment with description
- Secondary audience segment (if applicable)
- Audience pain points and motivations
- Where they spend time (channels, communities, publications)
- Buying stage alignment (awareness, consideration, decision)

### 3. Key Messages
- Core campaign message (one sentence)
- 3-4 supporting messages tailored to audience pain points
- Message variations by channel (if different tones are needed)
- Proof points or evidence to support each message

### 4. Channel Strategy
Recommend channels based on audience and goal. For each channel, include:
- Why this channel fits the audience and objective
- Content format recommendations
- Estimated effort level (low, medium, high)
- Budget allocation suggestion (if budget was provided)

Consider channels from:
- Owned: blog, email, website, social media profiles
- Earned: PR, influencer partnerships, guest posts, community engagement
- Paid: search ads, social ads, display, sponsored content, events

### 5. Content Calendar
Create a week-by-week (or day-by-day for short campaigns) content calendar:
- What content to produce each week
- Which channel each piece targets
- Key milestones and deadlines
- Dependencies between pieces (e.g., "landing page must be live before paid ads launch")

Format as a table:

| Week | Content Piece | Channel | Owner/Notes | Status |
|------|--------------|---------|-------------|--------|

**Make it live, not static** (P5): offer to materialize this calendar as a Lark Base via **`base-deploy`** (table "Campaign Calendar"), then keep it in sync with `lark_base_record_upsert`. For each row that has an owner and a due date, offer to create the matching Lark task (`lark_contact_search` → `lark_task_create`, `dry_run` first). The markdown table is the preview; the Base is the system-of-record.

### 6. Content Pieces Needed
List every content asset required for the campaign:
- Asset name and type (blog post, email, social post, ad creative, landing page, etc.)
- Brief description of what it should contain
- Priority (must-have vs. nice-to-have)
- Suggested timeline for creation

### 7. Success Metrics
Define KPIs aligned to the campaign objective:
- Primary KPI with target number
- Secondary KPIs (3-5)
- How each metric will be tracked
- Reporting cadence recommendation

For benchmarks: pull historical campaign results from the team's marketing Base (`lark_base_search` — pass `search_fields` for the field(s) to match; if you don't know the field names, discover them first via `lark_api GET /open-apis/bitable/v1/apps/{base}/tables/{table}/fields`; narrow with `select_fields`/`limit`, not `jq` — base_search does not support jq) and from past reports in Wiki/Docs (`lark_doc_search`, projected under `.data.results[]`). If a specialty `~~product analytics` MCP (e.g. Amplitude) is connected, use it for harder numbers — keep that external tool as-is; only the planning/tracking layer is Lark.

### 8. Budget Allocation (if budget provided)
- Breakdown by channel or activity
- Production costs vs. distribution costs
- Contingency recommendation (typically 10-15%)

### 9. Risks and Mitigations
- 2-3 potential risks (timeline, audience mismatch, channel underperformance)
- Mitigation strategy for each

### 10. Next Steps
- Immediate action items to kick off the campaign — offer to create these as Lark tasks (resolve owner via `lark_contact_search`, `lark_task_create` with `dry_run`, P1/P2)
- Stakeholder approvals needed — route as a real Lark approval instance via the **`lark-approval`** skill (P7), not an informal chat ask
- Key decision points — log decisions to a Base (P5) and surface for sign-off as an interactive card (P4)

## Planning Reference

### Campaign Framework: Objective, Audience, Message, Channel, Measure

Every campaign should be built on this five-part framework:

#### Objective
Define what success looks like before planning anything else.

- **Awareness**: increase brand or product visibility (measured by reach, impressions, share of voice)
- **Consideration**: drive engagement and education (measured by content engagement, email signups, webinar attendance)
- **Conversion**: generate leads or sales (measured by signups, demos, purchases, pipeline)
- **Retention**: re-engage existing customers (measured by churn reduction, upsell, NPS)
- **Advocacy**: turn customers into promoters (measured by referrals, reviews, UGC)

Good objectives are SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound.

Example: "Generate 200 marketing qualified leads from mid-market SaaS companies in North America within 6 weeks of campaign launch."

#### Audience
Define who you are trying to reach with enough specificity to guide messaging and channel decisions.

- **Demographics**: role/title, seniority, company size, industry
- **Psychographics**: motivations, pain points, goals, objections
- **Behavioral**: where they consume content, how they buy, what they have engaged with before
- **Buying stage**: are they unaware of the problem, researching solutions, or ready to buy?

Create a brief audience profile (not a full persona) for campaign planning:
> "[Role] at [company type] who is struggling with [pain point] and looking for [desired outcome]. They typically discover solutions through [channels] and care most about [priorities]."

#### Message
Craft the core message and supporting points that will resonate with the audience.

- **Core message**: one sentence that captures what you want the audience to think, feel, or do
- **Supporting messages**: 3-4 points that provide evidence, address objections, or elaborate on benefits
- **Proof points**: data, case studies, testimonials, or third-party validation for each supporting message
- **Differentiation**: what makes your offering different from alternatives (including doing nothing)

Message hierarchy:
1. Why should I care? (addresses the pain point or opportunity)
2. What is the solution? (positions your offering)
3. Why you? (differentiates from alternatives)
4. What should I do? (call to action)

#### Channel
Select channels based on where your audience is, not where you are most comfortable. See the Channel Selection Guide below.

#### Measure
Define how you will know the campaign worked. See Success Metrics by Campaign Type below.

### Channel Selection Guide

#### Owned Channels

| Channel | Best For | Typical Metrics | Effort |

| Sponsored content | Thought leadership, lead gen | Engagement, leads, cost per lead | Medium |
| Events/Sponsorships | Relationship building, brand | Leads, meetings, pipeline influenced | High |

#### Channel Selection Criteria
When choosing channels, consider:
- Where does your target audience spend time?
- What is the buying stage you are targeting? (awareness channels vs. conversion channels)
- What is your budget? (paid channels require spend; owned/earned require time)
- What content assets do you already have or can you produce?
- What has worked in the past? (reference historical data if available)

### Content Calendar Creation

#### Calendar Planning Process
1. **Start with milestones**: campaign launch, event dates, product releases, seasonal moments
2. **Work backward**: what needs to be live and when? What is the production lead time?
3. **Map content to funnel stages**: ensure coverage across awareness, consideration, and conversion
4. **Batch by theme**: group related content pieces into weekly or bi-weekly themes
5. **Balance channels**: do not over-index on one channel; ensure the audience sees the campaign across touchpoints
6. **Build in flexibility**: leave 20% of calendar slots open for reactive or opportunistic content

#### Content Cadence Guidelines
- **Blog**: 1-4 posts per week depending on team size and goals
- **Email newsletter**: weekly or bi-weekly for most audiences
- **Social media**: 3-7 posts per week per platform (varies by platform)
- **Paid campaigns**: continuous during campaign window with creative refreshes every 2-4 weeks
- **Webinars**: monthly or quarterly depending on resources

#### Production Timeline Benchmarks
- Blog post: 3-5 business days (research, draft, review, publish)
- Email campaign: 2-3 business days (copy, design, test, send)
- Social media posts: 1-2 business days (draft, design, schedule)
- Landing page: 5-7 business days (copy, design, development, QA)
- Video content: 2-4 weeks (script, production, editing)
- Ebook/whitepaper: 2-4 weeks (outline, draft, design, review)

### Budget Allocation Approaches

#### Percentage of Revenue Method
- Industry benchmark: 5-15% of revenue for marketing, with B2B typically at 5-10% and B2C at 10-15%
- Startups and growth-stage companies often invest 15-25% of revenue in marketing
- Within the marketing budget, allocate across brand (long-term) and performance (short-term)

#### Channel Allocation Framework
A common starting framework (adjust based on goals and historical data):

| Category | Percentage of Budget | Examples |
|----------|---------------------|----------|
| Paid acquisition | 30-40% | Search ads, social ads, display |
| Content production | 20-30% | Blog, video, design, ebooks |
| Events and sponsorships | 10-20% | Conferences, webinars, meetups |
| Tools and technology | 10-15% | Analytics, automation, CRM |
| Testing and experimentation | 5-10% | New channels, A/B tests, pilots |

#### Budget Optimization Principles
- Start with your highest-confidence channel and allocate 60-70% of paid budget there
- Reserve 15-20% for testing new channels or tactics
- Shift budget monthly based on performance data (do not set and forget)
- Account for production costs, not just media spend
- Include a 10-15% contingency for unexpected opportunities or overruns

## Output

Present the full campaign brief with clear headings and formatting. Then offer to land it natively:
- Publish the brief to **Wiki** (`lark_wiki_node_create` + body via **`lark-doc`**, P8).
- Scaffold the content calendar as a **Lark Base** via **`base-deploy`** (P5) and create owner tasks (P1/P2).
- Announce it as an interactive **card** to the team channel (`lark_im_card_send`, P4) with links to the Wiki brief and Base.

After the brief, ask:

"Would you like me to:
- Publish this brief to Wiki and stand up the calendar as a Lark Base?
- Dive deeper into any section?
- Draft specific content pieces from the calendar (hands off to `/draft-content`)?
- Create a competitive analysis to inform the messaging (`/competitive-brief`)?
- Adjust the plan for a different budget or timeline?"
